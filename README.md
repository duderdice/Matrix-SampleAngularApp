# SampleAngularApp

Sample app for demonstrating Angular architectural and project patterns.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` to run the app locally.
Alternatively, run `npm run start:mock` to run the app locally using mock data.
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser. Note, the app should automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.


## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).


## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `npm run start`.
